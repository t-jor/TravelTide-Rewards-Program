# TravelTide Customer Segmentation Project

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
TravelTide is a fast-growing e-booking startup that has built one of the largest online travel inventories.  
While the platform has grown quickly since its launch in 2021, customer retention remains a challenge.  

The new Head of Marketing, **Elena Tarrant**, has been tasked with designing a **personalized rewards program** to increase customer loyalty.  
Our role as the **Analytics team** is to segment customers, validate which rewards are most attractive, and provide **data-driven recommendations** to improve retention.

## ðŸŽ¯ Business Problem
- TravelTide customers currently have access to a broad travel inventory but retention is weak.  
- Marketing aims to personalize the **rewards program** by matching perks to customer segments.  
- The analytics team must:
  1. Verify whether the data supports distinct customer groups with clear perk preferences.
  2. Assign each customer a likely "favorite perk."
  3. Provide actionable recommendations for personalized marketing campaigns.

**Proposed Perks:**
- Free hotel meal  
- Free checked bag  
- No cancellation fees  
- Exclusive discounts  
- 1 night free hotel with flight
