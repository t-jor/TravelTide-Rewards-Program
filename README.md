# TravelTide Customer Segmentation Project

## 📖 Project Overview

TravelTide is a fast-growing e-booking startup that has built one of the largest online travel inventories.  
While the platform has grown quickly since its launch in 2021, **customer retention remains a challenge**.  

The new Head of Marketing, **Elena Tarrant**, has been tasked with designing a **personalized rewards program** to increase customer loyalty.  
Our role as the **Analytics team** is to segment customers, validate which rewards are most attractive, and provide **data-driven recommendations** to improve retention.

## 🎯 Business Problem

- TravelTide has seen strong user growth since 2021, but **growth ≠ loyalty**.  
- Retention rates fall year over year, and booking users drop sharply (halved after 2 years).  
- Marketing aims to personalize the rewards program by matching perks to customer segments.  
- The analytics team must:  
  1. Verify whether the data supports distinct customer groups with clear perk preferences.  
  2. Assign each customer a likely "favorite perk."  
  3. Provide actionable recommendations for personalized marketing campaigns.

**Perks considered in the program:**  

- ❌ Free Cancellation  
- 🍽 Free Hotel Meal  
- 🧳 Free Checked Bag  
- 🏷 Discount Offers  
- ✈️+🏨 1 Free Hotel Night with Flight
